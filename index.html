             After accidentally merging my changes to our group project to the master branch without first creating a PR request, I feel completely dumb and like I let down my group and added extra work for them to clean up. Although I know this kind of thing happens, I can't help but feel like the weak link in my group. I've resolved to learn more intricacies of the GitHub process and be more careful when working on branches and committing changes. 
           </p>
           <p>
             Instead of wallowing in self-doubt, I will continue to learn at whatever pace I can. I almost got to the point of giving up on coding all together, but I do enjoy certain aspects of development, so maybe I just need to relax and remember I'm only human.

             Hello, my name is Matthew Choat and I'm currently a student in SMU's "Full-stack Web Development Boot Camp". I'll be using this blog to catalogue my struggles, victories, and general quandries regarding all things code. My educational and professional background is in technical writing for software, but until June of 2019, I hadn't been exposed to much coding. This has been an eyeopening and at times, soul crushing experience so far, but I'm committed now to finishing strong and continuing my coding journey after the program ends.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm currently learning Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, and jQuery. It's quite a lot of information to fit into a 24 week program, but the end is in sight and hopefully I'm on the path to learn skills that will not only improve my own life, but the life of my family as well.
